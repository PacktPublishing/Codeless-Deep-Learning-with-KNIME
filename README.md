**Build, train, and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform**

## What is this book about?
KNIME Analytics Platform is an open source software used to create and design data science workflows. This book is a comprehensive guide to the KNIME GUI and KNIME deep learning integration, helping you build neural network models without writing any code. It’ll guide you in building simple and complex neural networks through practical and creative solutions for solving real-world data problems.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use various common nodes to transform your data into the right structure suitable for training a neural network
* Understand neural network techniques such as loss functions, backpropagation, and hyperparameters
* Prepare and encode data appropriately to feed it into the network
* Build and train a classic feedforward network
* Develop and optimize an autoencoder network for outlier detection

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data analysts, data scientists, and deep learning developers who are not well-versed in Python but want to learn how to use KNIME GUI to build, train, test, and deploy neural networks with different architectures. The practical implementations shown in the book do not require coding or any knowledge of dedicated scripts, so you can easily implement your knowledge into practical applications. No prior experience of using KNIME is required to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
