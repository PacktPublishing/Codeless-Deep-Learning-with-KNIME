**Build, train, and deploy various deep neural network architectures using KNIME Analytics Platform**

## What is this book about?
KNIME Analytics Platform is an open source software used to create and design data science workflows. This book is a comprehensive guide to the KNIME GUI and KNIME deep learning integration, helping you build neural network models without writing any code. It’ll guide you in building simple and complex neural networks through practical and creative solutions for solving real-world data problems.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use various common nodes to transform your data into the right structure suitable for training a neural network
* Understand neural network techniques such as loss functions, backpropagation, and hyperparameters
* Prepare and encode data appropriately to feed it into the network
* Build and train a classic feedforward network
* Develop and optimize an autoencoder network for outlier detection
